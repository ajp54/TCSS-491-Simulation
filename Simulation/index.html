        <font size=5>
        <b>Green Cells:</b> These are food for the non-red cells. A new green cell is generated every 0.5 seconds
        and there is a small chance that a newly spawned green cell will mutate into a white cell.<br>
        <b>Red Cells:</b> These are the preditor cells. They hunt the non-green cells for food but can die 
        if they do not eat anything for long enough. if a red cell eats enough other cells it will 
        produce a new red cell.<br>
        <b>White Cells:</b> These cells eat the green cells and run from the red cells. If a white cell eats 
        enough food, it will produce a new cell. Anytime a new cell is produced, it has a small chance 
        of mutating into a cell with slightly different attributes.<br>
        <b>Other Colored Cells:</b> a cell that is any other color is one that has mutated from a white cell. The
        attributes that change include the cell's speed, color, size, range at which is can see other cells,
        and number of children it reproduces at a time.
